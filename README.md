# Load-Feature-classes-with-info-from-a-GDB

With this code you can load all the feature classes from a GDB that has at least one record in the current DataFrame only indicating the GDB path

To use it you have to:

1. Save this file as a python script
2. Create a toolbox and then add the file 
3. In display name add the name that you want to appear in the tool, in datatype you have to select "Any value"
(I'm not sure if you can select another data type but this code works with it)

Finish.

The next thing is to execute the code from the toolbox, drag the gdb or copy the path and run.

NOTE: THE PATH MUST NOT HAVE SPACES BECAUSE THE SCRIPT WON'T WORK
